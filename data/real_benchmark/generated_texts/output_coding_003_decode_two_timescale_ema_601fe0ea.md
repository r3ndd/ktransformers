### Generated Text

Here is a design for a simple REST API for a Todo List application, including the endpoint specifications and a basic Python implementation using Flask.

### **1: API Design**

The API follows a standard REST approach (CRUD) operations. The data format is JSON (JSON). The authentication mechanism is no state (stateless) (session token or session). The error response is standard HTTP status code.

The following endpoints are defined:
